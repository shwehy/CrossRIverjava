# CrossRiverjava
River Crossing IQ Logic Puzzles require you to get all of the characters(crossers) across a river
in a small boat. The boat can cross the river many times to get anyone across. In our game
each character(crosser) has some properties, the most important are:
  ● Weight: This property represents the weight of a crosser.
  ● Eating Rank: This property represents the eating rank of a crosser. Crossers with higher
    eating ranks can eat crossers with lower eating ranks.
We have three major categories of crossers in our game(farmers, animals, plants). Farmers
don’t eat any crosser, can’t be eaten by any crosser and can raft the boat. Animals and plants
cannot raft the boat. There are two major types of animals (carnivorous and herbivorous).
Carnivorous can only eat herbivorous but can’t eat plants. Herbivorous can only eat plants.
This game has many challenging stories, for this assignment you have to implement at least 2
stories.

Story1:
“A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a carnivorous, a herbivorous and
plant.”
Rules:
1. The farmer is the only one who can sail the boat. He can only take one passenger, in
addition to himself.
2. You can not leave any two crossers on the same bank if they can harm(eat) each other
How can the farmer get across the river with all the 2 animals and the plant without any losses?
Story2:
“Four farmers and their animal need to cross a river in a small boat. The weights of the
farmers are 90 kg, 80 kg,60 kg and 40 kg respectively, and the weight of the animal is
20 kg.”

Rules:
1. The boat cannot bear a load heavier than 100 kg.
2. All farmers can raft, while the animal cannot.
How can they all get to the other side with their animal?
